In this project, you'll learn how to create a fun prank in Scratch with a fake slideshow that features a spooky surprise! 

The project goes something like this:

1. We'll start by deleting the Scratch Cat and adding a spooky sprite. Then, we'll code the slideshow to switch backdrops every few seconds when the green flag is clicked. 
2. For the surprise, we'll hide the ghost sprite at first, then show it with a spooky sound. To make the surprise even more interesting, we can use a "pick random" block to randomize the timing.

You can see an example of the completed project at [this link](https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/1049245394/) if you want!
