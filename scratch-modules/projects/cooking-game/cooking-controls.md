In Scratch, variables act like labeled boxes that hold different types of information, such as numbers or text, which can be used in different parts of your project. For example, in a game, you could use a variable to control the speed of characters without manually changing each one. To create a variable, go to the "Variables" tab and click "Make a Variable." Pick a name that helps you remember what's inside. 

You can make a list for a specific Sprite or all Sprites. Lists are handy for things like keeping track of a player's inventory. You can add, insert, replace, or delete items from a list, and even check if a list contains a specific item. Lists can be displayed on the stage, and you can manually add, remove, or resize them. Plus, you can import or export text files to save your lists for later. Variables and lists are powerful tools in Scratch for storing and managing information in your projects.
